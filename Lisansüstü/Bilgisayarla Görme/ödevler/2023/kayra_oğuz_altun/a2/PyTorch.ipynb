When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"89jc0ePvPEWo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701241181481,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Kayra","userId":"10105705821450407149"}}},"source":["# DenseNet approach based on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993\n","# Implementation details: https://amaarora.github.io/2020/08/02/densenets.html\n","\n","from collections import OrderedDict\n","\n","class _Transition(nn.Sequential):\n","    \"\"\"A transition layer used between each dense block.\"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):\n","        \"\"\"Initializes the transition layer.\n","\n","        Only `1` convolutional layer is used with kernel size of `1` to reduce the\n","        _depth_ of the _activation maps_ from `in_channels` to `out_channels`.\n","\n","        Args:\n","            in_channels (int): The number of input channels\n","            out_channels (int): The number of output channels\n","        \"\"\"\n","        super().__init__()\n","\n","        #

network."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"tags":["pdf-inline"],"id":"YRoKQY0uyxu9"},"source":["**Answer:**\n","\n","### Network design\n","I used a **DenseNet** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)) with the following architecture:\n","1. `CONV->NORM->RELU`\n","    * As the input is of shape `32x32x3`, initially I used a convolution layer with filter size `7x7` to produce `32` _activation maps_. Padding of `3` was used to preserve the input spacial dimension.\n","    * The `32` _activation maps_, each of shape `32x32`, were then passed through _batchnorm_ layer and through _ReLU_ nonlinearity\n","2. `BLOCK->TRANS->BLOCK->TRANS->BLOCK`\n","    * In general each block has a certain number of layers, each of which perfom a _convolution_, _batchnorm_ and _ReLU_. Each layer concatinates its input with every other layer's output within the same block. Throughout the convolutions in the block, the spacial size of each _activation map_ is preserved, however, the channel size grows by a constant of `16` after each layer produces an output.\n","    * Each transition layer simply performs a _convolution_ to reduce the channel size by a factor of `2`. We also have _average pooling_ whith reducs the spatial dimension also by a factor of `2`. As in any other group of layers, there is a _normalization_ layer and _ReLU_ nonlinearity.\n","    * I used `6` layers in the first block, `12` in the second and `8` in the final one. Thus the 'preprocessed' input of size `32x32x32` after each block and transition had its shape modified in had its dimensions changed in the following way `32x32x128->16x16x64->16x16x256->8x8x128->8x8x256` (based on the provided sequence of blocks and transitions).\n","3. `NORM->RELU->POOL->SOFTMAX`\n","    * The raw activation maps are passed through _batchnorm_ and _ReLU_, a _global average pooling_ is performed to get the final activation shape of `1x1x256` which is then flattened to a linear classifier which produces scores based on the _Softmax_ loss function.\n","\n","> Key motivation is that by allowing subsequent layers to see the outputs of every previous layer it makes the network more rubust in recognizing certain details. For example, if one layer detects edges and a subsequent layer detects shapes, sometimes it may be better to see the shape before deciding on the edge.\n","\n","### Hyperparameters\n","I only fine-tuned 3 hyperparameters - _learning rate_, _weight decay_ and _drop rate_. As it turns out, dropout and regularization do not impact performance much, in many cases - even make it worse, possibly due to heavy use of batch normalization which already make sthe network robust. I settled on the learning rate of `0.0015`, larger values make the validation accuracy too unstable during training."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"osHaEcx1yxu9"},"source":["## Test set -- run this only once\n","\n","Now that we've gotten a result we're happy with, we test our final model on the test set (which you should store in best_model).
